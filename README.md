# Airbnb_Data_Analysis

#### This repository analyzes Airbnb data for Los Angeles using publicly available InsideAirbnb datasets (listings, reviews, and calendar). The goal is to produce clear, reproducible insights that answer three core questions:

-Which neighborhoods host the most listings? — neighborhood-level aggregation and mapping to identify supply hotspots.

-What property types receive the most positive reviews? — review score analysis by room/property type to surface guest-preferred stays.

-How much revenue do successful hosts generate? — revenue estimation using price and occupancy signals to benchmark top-performing hosts.

The repo includes data cleaning scripts, exploratory notebooks, and visualization outputs to support evidence-based conclusions and easy reuse.
